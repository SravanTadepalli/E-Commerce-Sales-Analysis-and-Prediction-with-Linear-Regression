# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression

## # Linear Regression (E-Commerce) Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze an e-commerce dataset and predict customer spending using Linear Regression. The goal is to determine the factors influencing customer purchases and provide insights for business decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of customer information and their spending behavior on an e-commerce platform. The key features include:

- **Customer ID** - Unique identifier for each customer
- **Age** - Age of the customer
- **Annual Income** - Customer's annual income
- **Website Session Time** - Time spent by the customer on the e-commerce platform
- **Time on App** - Time spent on the mobile application
- **Time on Website** - Time spent on the website
- **Length of Membership** - Duration of customer membership
- **Yearly Amount Spent** - Total yearly spending by the customer (Target Variable)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Convert categorical variables (if applicable)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize relationships between features and target variable
   - Check for correlations
   - Identify trends and patterns
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Select relevant features
   - Scale/normalize data if necessary
4. **Model Building**
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets
   - Train a Linear Regression model
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
5. **Model Interpretation and Insights**
   - Analyze the impact of each feature on spending behavior
   - Provide business recommendations based on findings

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results and Insights

- The model provides an estimate of how much a customer is likely to spend based on the given features.
- Identifies key drivers of customer spending behavior.
- Business strategies can be tailored to target high-value customers effectively.

## Future Improvements

- Implement polynomial regression or other advanced models to improve accuracy.
- Include additional features such as customer purchase history or browsing behavior.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
